# TestingForTrust-TFT-
Tool to Validate ML Models in a holistic manner using existing methods. Helps to explore the input space in a convenient way & discover failure cases as a pre-emptive measure.
# ABOUT THE CODE (HOW TO USE THIS LIBRARY):
1. The package "tft" (folder tft) has been organized with following files.
(a) to test image classifier models using existing methods : generalization_image.py, robustness_image.py & interpretability_image.py 
(b) to test word embedding models using existing methods: robustness_text.py
2. These files are the starting point if one wishes to have a look at. The research citations and documentations have been provided wherever necessary in these files. 
3. UserModel files need to be created by users like ML Developers/Data scientists for validating with respect to methods as per aforementioned files.
4. Includes a .whl file to install using "pip".
5. Please refer the guide(TFT_UserGuide_v1.5.pdf) in this repo, for installation instructions & usage details.
